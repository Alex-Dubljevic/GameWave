## What is GameWave?

GameWave is a project that I created for a computer science class and it is a mock video game marketplace where users can signup, login, get recommended games, and leave reviews. The project makes use of a Java Swing frontend, and a localhost server backend completely in Java. I coded the entire frontend of the application, the recommendation algorithm, and some of the server endpoints including proper HTTP request processing. One team member helped make the rest of the server while others contributed through data entry and writing descriptions/making images.
