To run this program, open the link to the repl.it repository and fork the project. Next run the forked version and open the "output" tab to use it. I coded the entire frontend of the application, the recommendation algorithm as well as some of the server endpoints with proper request processing. One team member helped make the rest of the server while others contributed through data entry and writing descriptions/making images.
